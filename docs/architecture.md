# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR-001: State Management - Zustand over React Context

**Date**: 2024-10-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to choose a state management solution for the Team Management application.

**Decision**: Use Zustand for state management instead of React Context.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Zustand provides optimized re-renders through selective subscriptions, avoiding unnecessary component updates that Context can cause
- **Simplicity**: Zustand has a minimal API surface and requires less boilerplate compared to Context + useReducer patterns
- **TypeScript Support**: Excellent TypeScript integration with minimal configuration
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller footprint compared to Redux Toolkit or other state management libraries
- **Developer Experience**: Clean, intuitive API that's easy to test and debug

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Reduced bundle size and improved performance
- ✅ Simplified state logic with less boilerplate
- ✅ Better TypeScript integration
- ✅ Easier testing and debugging
- ⚠️ Team needs to learn Zustand patterns (minimal learning curve)

## ADR-002: Form Management - React Hook Form + Zod over Formik + Yup

**Date**: 2024-10-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to choose a form management and validation solution.

**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Zod validation instead of Formik with Yup.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: React Hook Form uses uncontrolled components by default, reducing re-renders significantly
- **Bundle Size**: React Hook Form + Zod has a smaller bundle size compared to Formik + Yup
- **TypeScript Integration**: Zod provides excellent TypeScript inference and type safety
- **Validation**: Zod offers more powerful validation capabilities and better error messages
- **Modern Patterns**: React Hook Form aligns better with modern React patterns and hooks

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better performance with fewer re-renders
- ✅ Smaller bundle size
- ✅ Superior TypeScript support
- ✅ More powerful validation capabilities
- ⚠️ Different API patterns compared to Formik (manageable transition)

## ADR-003: UI Components - shadcn/ui over Custom Components

**Date**: 2024-10-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to choose a UI component library for consistent design and rapid development.

**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui components instead of building custom components or using other libraries.

**Rationale**:
- **Customization**: shadcn/ui provides copy-paste components that can be fully customized
- **Accessibility**: Built on Radix UI primitives, ensuring excellent accessibility out of the box
- **Design System**: Consistent design tokens and styling approach
- **Bundle Size**: Only includes components you actually use, no unused code
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Maintenance**: Components are part of your codebase, reducing dependency on external updates

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Full control over component styling and behavior
- ✅ Excellent accessibility support
- ✅ Consistent design system
- ✅ Optimal bundle size
- ✅ Easy customization and theming
- ⚠️ Requires manual component installation and setup

## ADR-004: Data Architecture - Client-side Pagination over Server-side

**Date**: 2024-10-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to choose pagination strategy for the teams table.

**Decision**: Implement client-side pagination instead of server-side pagination.

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Client-side pagination is simpler to implement with mock data
- **Performance**: With 500+ records, client-side pagination provides good performance
- **User Experience**: Instant filtering and sorting without network requests
- **Offline Support**: Works without network connectivity
- **Development Speed**: Faster to implement and test during development phase

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simpler implementation and testing
- ✅ Better user experience with instant interactions
- ✅ Works offline
- ⚠️ Limited scalability with very large datasets (500+ records is manageable)
- ⚠️ Initial load time increases with dataset size

**Note**: For production with real APIs and larger datasets, server-side pagination would be preferred.

## ADR-005: Project Structure - Feature-based over Layer-based

**Date**: 2024-10-06  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to organize the codebase for maintainability and scalability.

**Decision**: Use feature-based folder structure instead of layer-based structure.

**Rationale**:
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new features without affecting existing code
- **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different features independently
- **Code Locality**: Related code (components, hooks, types) are co-located
- **Maintenance**: Easier to find and modify feature-specific code
- **Testing**: Feature-based structure makes it easier to write focused tests

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better code organization and maintainability
- ✅ Easier team collaboration
- ✅ Improved code locality
- ✅ Simpler testing strategies
- ⚠️ Potential for code duplication across features (mitigated by shared components)

**Structure**:
```
src/
├── features/           # Feature-based modules
│   └── teams/         # Team management feature
│       ├── components/
│       ├── hooks/
│       └── pages/
├── shared/            # Shared across features
│   └── components/
├── lib/              # Utilities and configurations
└── types/           # Global type definitions
```
